Cinnamon tea is full of compounds that may offer various heath benefits. 
These include improving heart health, alleviating menstrual cramps, and 
reducing inflammation and blood sugar levels. Cinnamon is rich in antioxidants, 
which fight off oxidation caused by free radicals. It may also help slow the 
breakdown of carbs in your gut, preventing your blood sugar from spiking after 
meals. The spice may also reduce blood pressure, as well as triglyceride and 
LDL (bad) cholesterol levels in some individuals. A review of 10 studies found 
that consuming as little as 120 mg of cinnamon — less than a 1/10 teaspoon — 
each day may be sufficient to help you reap these benefits. However, excess 
intake of coumarins may reduce liver function and increase the risk of bleeding.
