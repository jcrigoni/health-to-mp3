These may provide similar benefits to a ketogenic diet, such 
as improved athletic and mental performance. More scientific 
research is needed to determine if these supplements work.

triglyceride) powder, malic acid, ascorbic acid and the natural, 
zero-calorie sweetener Stevia. They are gluten-free but do 
contain milk ingredients. The type of ketone found in PrüVit OS 
supplements is called beta-hydroxybutyrate. It is the form 
found in most exogenous Ketone supplements available on the 
market, including Ketone OS.
